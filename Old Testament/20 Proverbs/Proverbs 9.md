###### 1
1 Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:
###### 2
2 She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.
###### 3
3 She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,
###### 4
4 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,
###### 5
5 Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.
###### 6
6 Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.
###### 7
7 He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot.
###### 8
8 Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.
###### 9
9 Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.
###### 10
10 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.
###### 11
11 For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.
###### 12
12 If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.
###### 13
13 A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing.
###### 14
14 For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,
###### 15
15 To call passengers who go right on their ways:
###### 16
16 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,
###### 17
17 Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.
###### 18
18 But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell.
