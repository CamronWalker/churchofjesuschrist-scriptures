###### 1
1 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
###### 2
2 Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest?
###### 3
3 Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?
###### 4
4 Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for any work?
###### 5
5 Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for any work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned?
###### 6
6 Therefore thus saith the Lord God; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
###### 7
7 And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one fire, and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I set my face against them.
###### 8
8 And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord God.
