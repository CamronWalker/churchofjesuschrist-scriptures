###### 1
1 My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me.
###### 2
2 Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?
###### 3
3 Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?
###### 4
4 For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.
###### 5
5 He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.
###### 6
6 He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.
###### 7
7 Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow.
###### 8
8 Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.
###### 9
9 The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.
###### 10
10 But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you.
###### 11
11 My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart.
###### 12
12 They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness.
###### 13
13 If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness.
###### 14
14 I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister.
###### 15
15 And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?
###### 16
16 They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.
