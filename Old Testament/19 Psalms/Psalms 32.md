###### 1
1 Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
###### 2
2 Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.
###### 3
3 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.
###### 4
4 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah.
###### 5
5 I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.
###### 6
6 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.
###### 7
7 Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.
###### 8
8 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.
###### 9
9 Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.
###### 10
10 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall compass him about.
###### 11
11 Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.
