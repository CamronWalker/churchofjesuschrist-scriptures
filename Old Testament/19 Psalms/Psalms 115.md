###### 1
1 Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.
###### 2
2 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?
###### 3
3 But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.
###### 4
4 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
###### 5
5 They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:
###### 6
6 They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:
###### 7
7 They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.
###### 8
8 They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them.
###### 9
9 O Israel, trust thou in the Lord: he is their help and their shield.
###### 10
10 O house of Aaron, trust in the Lord: he is their help and their shield.
###### 11
11 Ye that fear the Lord, trust in the Lord: he is their help and their shield.
###### 12
12 The Lord hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.
###### 13
13 He will bless them that fear the Lord, both small and great.
###### 14
14 The Lord shall increase you more and more, you and your children.
###### 15
15 Ye are blessed of the Lord which made heaven and earth.
###### 16
16 The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord's: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.
###### 17
17 The dead praise not the Lord, neither any that go down into silence.
###### 18
18 But we will bless the Lord from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the Lord.
