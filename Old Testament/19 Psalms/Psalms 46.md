###### 1
1 God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
###### 2
2 Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;
###### 3
3 Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.
###### 4
4 There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.
###### 5
5 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.
###### 6
6 The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.
###### 7
7 The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.
###### 8
8 Come, behold the works of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth.
###### 9
9 He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.
###### 10
10 Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.
###### 11
11 The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.
