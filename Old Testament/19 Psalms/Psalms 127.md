###### 1
1 Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.
###### 2
2 It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.
###### 3
3 Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.
###### 4
4 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth.
###### 5
5 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.
