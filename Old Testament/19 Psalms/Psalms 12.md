###### 1
1 Help, Lord; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.
###### 2
2 They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.
###### 3
3 The Lord shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things:
###### 4
4 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?
###### 5
5 For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him.
###### 6
6 The words of the Lord are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.
###### 7
7 Thou shalt keep them, O Lord, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.
###### 8
8 The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.
