###### 1
1 Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.
###### 2
2 Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.
###### 3
3 For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.
###### 4
4 Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.
###### 5
5 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth.
###### 6
6 I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O Lord; for it is good.
###### 7
7 For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.
