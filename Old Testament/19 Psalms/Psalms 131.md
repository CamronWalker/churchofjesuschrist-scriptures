###### 1
1 Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.
###### 2
2 Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.
###### 3
3 Let Israel hope in the Lord from henceforth and for ever.
