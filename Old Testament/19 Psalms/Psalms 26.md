###### 1
1 Judge me, O Lord; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the Lord; therefore I shall not slide.
###### 2
2 Examine me, O Lord, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.
###### 3
3 For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth.
###### 4
4 I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.
###### 5
5 I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked.
###### 6
6 I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O Lord:
###### 7
7 That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.
###### 8
8 Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.
###### 9
9 Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:
###### 10
10 In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.
###### 11
11 But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me.
###### 12
12 My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the Lord.
