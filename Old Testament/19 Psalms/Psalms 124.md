###### 2
2 If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men rose up against us:
###### 3
3 Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us:
###### 4
4 Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:
###### 5
5 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.
###### 6
6 Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.
###### 7
