###### 1
1 When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.
###### 2
2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them.
###### 3
3 The Lord hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.
###### 4
4 Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the south.
###### 5
5 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
###### 6
6 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.
