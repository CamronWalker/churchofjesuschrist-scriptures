###### 1
1 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?
###### 2
2 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying,
###### 3
3 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.
###### 4
4 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.
###### 5
5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.
###### 6
6 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.
###### 7
7 I will declare the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.
###### 8
8 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.
###### 9
9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.
###### 10
10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.
###### 11
11 Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
###### 12
12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.
