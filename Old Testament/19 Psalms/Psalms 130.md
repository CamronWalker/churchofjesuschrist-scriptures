###### 1
1 Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord.
###### 2
2 Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.
###### 3
3 If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?
###### 4
4 But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.
###### 5
5 I wait for the Lord, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.
###### 6
6 My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.
###### 7
7 Let Israel hope in the Lord: for with the Lord there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.
###### 8
8 And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
