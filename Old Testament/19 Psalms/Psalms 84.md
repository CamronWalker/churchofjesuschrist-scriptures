###### 1
1 How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts!
###### 2
2 My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.
###### 3
3 Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my King, and my God.
###### 4
4 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah.
###### 5
5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them.
###### 6
6 Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.
###### 7
7 They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God.
###### 8
8 O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.
###### 9
9 Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.
###### 10
10 For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
###### 11
11 For the Lord God is a sun and shield: the Lord will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.
###### 12
12 O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.
