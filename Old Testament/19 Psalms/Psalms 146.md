###### 1
1 Praise ye the Lord. Praise the Lord, O my soul.
###### 2
2 While I live will I praise the Lord: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.
###### 3
3 Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.
###### 4
4 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.
###### 5
5 Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God:
###### 6
6 Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth truth for ever:
###### 7
7 Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry. The Lord looseth the prisoners:
###### 8
8 The Lord openeth the eyes of the blind: the Lord raiseth them that are bowed down: the Lord loveth the righteous:
###### 9
9 The Lord preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.
###### 10
10 The Lord shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the Lord.
