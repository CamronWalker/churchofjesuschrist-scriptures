###### 1
1 Bless the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.
###### 2
2 Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:
###### 3
3 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;
###### 4
4 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;
###### 5
5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.
###### 6
6 The Lord executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.
###### 7
7 He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.
###### 8
8 The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.
###### 9
9 He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.
###### 10
10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
###### 11
11 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.
###### 12
12 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.
###### 13
13 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.
###### 14
14 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.
###### 15
15 As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.
###### 16
16 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.
###### 17
17 But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children;
###### 18
18 To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.
###### 19
19 The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.
###### 20
20 Bless the Lord, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.
###### 21
21 Bless ye the Lord, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.
###### 22
22 Bless the Lord, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the Lord, O my soul.
