###### 1
1 Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.
###### 2
2 For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
###### 3
3 O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.
###### 4
4 Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.
###### 5
5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.
