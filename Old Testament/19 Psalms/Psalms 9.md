###### 1
1 I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.
###### 2
2 I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.
###### 3
3 When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.
###### 4
4 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.
###### 5
5 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.
###### 6
6 O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.
###### 7
7 But the Lord shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.
###### 8
8 And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.
###### 9
9 The Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.
###### 10
10 And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.
###### 11
11 Sing praises to the Lord, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.
###### 12
12 When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.
###### 13
13 Have mercy upon me, O Lord; consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:
###### 14
14 That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.
###### 15
15 The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.
###### 16
16 The Lord is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.
###### 17
17 The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.
###### 18
18 For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever.
###### 19
19 Arise, O Lord; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight.
###### 20
20 Put them in fear, O Lord: that the nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah.
