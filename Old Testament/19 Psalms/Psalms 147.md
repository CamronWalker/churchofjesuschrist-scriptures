###### 16
16 He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.
###### 17
17 He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold?
###### 18
18 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow.
###### 19
19 He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel.
###### 20
