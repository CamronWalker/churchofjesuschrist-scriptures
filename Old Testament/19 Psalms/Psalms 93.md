###### 1
1 The Lord reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the Lord is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.
###### 2
2 Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.
###### 3
3 The floods have lifted up, O Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves.
###### 4
4 The Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.
###### 5
5 Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O Lord, for ever.
