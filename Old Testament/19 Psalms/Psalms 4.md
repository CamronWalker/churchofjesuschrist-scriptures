###### 1
1 Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.
###### 2
2 O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.
###### 3
3 But know that the Lord hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the Lord will hear when I call unto him.
###### 4
4 Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.
###### 5
5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the Lord.
###### 6
6 There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.
###### 7
7 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased.
###### 8
8 I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, Lord, only makest me dwell in safety.
