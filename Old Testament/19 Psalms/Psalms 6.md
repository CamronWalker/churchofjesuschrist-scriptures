###### 1
1 O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
###### 2
2 Have mercy upon me, O Lord; for I am weak: O Lord, heal me; for my bones are vexed.
###### 3
3 My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O Lord, how long?
###### 4
4 Return, O Lord, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake.
###### 5
5 For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?
###### 6
6 I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.
###### 7
7 Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.
###### 8
8 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping.
###### 9
9 The Lord hath heard my supplication; the Lord will receive my prayer.
###### 10
10 Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly.
