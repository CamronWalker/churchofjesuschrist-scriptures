###### 1
1 Praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the name of the Lord; praise him, O ye servants of the Lord.
###### 2
2 Ye that stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God,
###### 3
3 Praise the Lord; for the Lord is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant.
###### 4
4 For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure.
###### 5
5 For I know that the Lord is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.
###### 6
6 Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.
###### 7
7 He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.
###### 8
8 Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.
###### 9
9 Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.
###### 10
10 Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;
###### 11
11 Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan:
###### 12
12 And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people.
###### 13
13 Thy name, O Lord, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O Lord, throughout all generations.
###### 14
14 For the Lord will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.
###### 15
15 The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
###### 16
16 They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;
###### 17
17 They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths.
###### 18
18 They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that trusteth in them.
###### 19
19 Bless the Lord, O house of Israel: bless the Lord, O house of Aaron:
###### 20
20 Bless the Lord, O house of Levi: ye that fear the Lord, bless the Lord.
###### 21
21 Blessed be the Lord out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the Lord.
