###### 1
1 They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.
###### 2
2 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people from henceforth even for ever.
###### 3
3 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.
###### 4
4 Do good, O Lord, unto those that be good, and to them that are upright in their hearts.
###### 5
5 As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be upon Israel.
