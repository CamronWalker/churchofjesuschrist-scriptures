###### 2
2 Again, verily I say unto you that he can also lift up his voice in meetings, whenever it shall be expedient.
###### 3
3 And again, I say unto you that it shall be appointed unto him to keep the church record and history continually; for Oliver Cowdery I have appointed to another office.
###### 4
4 Wherefore, it shall be given him, inasmuch as he is faithful, by the Comforter, to write these things. Even so. Amen.
