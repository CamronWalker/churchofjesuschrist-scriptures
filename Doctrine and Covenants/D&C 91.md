###### 1
1 Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you concerning the Apocrypha--There are many things contained therein that are true, and it is mostly translated correctly;
###### 2
2 There are many things contained therein that are not true, which are interpolations by the hands of men.
###### 3
3 Verily, I say unto you, that it is not needful that the Apocrypha should be translated.
###### 4
4 Therefore, whoso readeth it, let him understand, for the Spirit manifesteth truth;
###### 5
5 And whoso is enlightened by the Spirit shall obtain benefit therefrom;
###### 6
6 And whoso receiveth not by the Spirit, cannot be benefited. Therefore it is not needful that it should be translated. Amen.
