###### 1
1 Dear and well-beloved brother, Brigham Young, verily thus saith the Lord unto you: My servant Brigham, it is no more required at your hand to leave your family as in times past, for your offering is acceptable to me.
###### 2
2 I have seen your labor and toil in journeyings for my name.
###### 3
3 I therefore command you to send my word abroad, and take especial care of your family from this time, henceforth and forever. Amen.
